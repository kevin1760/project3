            <p>Orlando is my favorite city to visit it is a must visit atleast one time in your life. I loved visiting 
            Orlando because the theme parks are of this world, I would say that both Disney and Universal are bigger and 
            funner than the ones in California. </p>
            
            <p> Why should you consider visiting Orlando well its a great place to take your family, it is a place for all ages. 
            If you are a Star wars fan, Marvel fan and Disney movies Orlando is the place to go. If you like Harry potter or transformers
            or even King Kong you know it Orlando is the place to go. If you arent into movies fear not because Orlando has more to offer
            than just theme parks you can see Sea creatures and animals and get in roller coasters and a place to take amazing pictures. 
            There is no better place to go for a sping or summer vacation as Orlando really gives the vacation vibe like no other place.</p>
            
            <p>Here are some top-rated attractions I will further address and you should explore:</p>
